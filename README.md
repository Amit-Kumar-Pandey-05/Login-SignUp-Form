# Basic Signup/Login Form Project

This basic signup/login form project provides a simple web interface for users to register and login to an application. The project consists of two main components: a signup form and a login form.

## Signup Form

The signup form allows new users to create an account by providing their name, email address, and password. Password validation ensures that the password meets specific criteria, including length, inclusion of special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. Upon submission, the user's information is stored securely for future login attempts.

## Login Form

The login form allows registered users to authenticate themselves by entering their email and password. Upon submission, the provided credentials are validated against the stored user data. If the credentials match, the user is granted access to the application, otherwise, an error message is displayed prompting the user to try again.

## Project Features

- User registration with name, email, and password.
- Password validation to ensure security requirements.
- User authentication using email and password.
- Error handling for incorrect login attempts.
- Potential for further extension with features such as password reset, email verification, and user profile management.

This project serves as a foundation for implementing user authentication and access control in web applications. It can be further extended and customized to enhance the user experience and security of the application.
